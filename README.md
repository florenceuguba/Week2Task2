Distinguish between Knowledge-Based and Database 
A database is a collection of information organized for easy access, management, and updating. The data it contains is in a basic form, and thus needs to be further analyzed and/or processed before it can be applied.

A knowledge base is a repository typically used to store answers to questions or solutions to problems enabling rapid search, retrieval, and reuse, either by help desk personnel, or directly by those needing support. A good example is Knowledge Centered Service (KCS). The entries in the knowledge base are fully-developed and ready to be applied.
